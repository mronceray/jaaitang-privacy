<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 17, 2025</p>

<p>Maxime Ronceray ("I", "me", "my") built <strong>JaaiTang!</strong> as a free, ad-supported app. This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use the app.</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>JaaiTang! does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The app does not require you to create an account, and no personal data (name, email, location, etc.) is ever collected by me.</p>
<p>Game progress and scores are stored locally on your device only and are not transmitted to any server.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services — Advertising</h2>
<p>The app displays ads provided by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may collect certain data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID)</li>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>General usage and interaction data</li>
</ul>
<p>When you first open the app, you will be asked via Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt whether you allow tracking for personalized ads. If you decline, only non-personalized ads will be shown.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>JaaiTang! is rated 4+ and is suitable for all ages. I do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since the app itself collects no data, there is no risk of children's data being stored or shared by me. AdMob may serve ads in compliance with Apple's guidelines and applicable laws (including COPPA).</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>Since no personal data is collected by JaaiTang!, there is no data to retain or delete. All game data is stored locally on your device and can be removed by uninstalling the app.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>You can reset your Advertising ID or enable "Limit Ad Tracking" in your device settings at any time. You can also deny the ATT prompt to prevent ad personalization.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact me at:<br>
