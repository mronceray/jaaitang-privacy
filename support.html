<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>How do I play?</h3>
<p>The cashier shows you a price. Your job is to pay the exact amount using Thai coins and bills. Tap the denominations to toss them on the counter, then hit CHECK to confirm.</p>

<h3>What is Challenge mode?</h3>
<p>In Challenge mode, the price is only spoken in Thai — it's not displayed on screen. You have to listen carefully and pay the right amount.</p>

<h3>How do I get a PERFECT score?</h3>
<p>Use the fewest coins and bills possible to pay the exact amount. For example, pay 50 baht with one 50฿ bill instead of five 10฿ coins.</p>

<h3>The app is crashing or not loading</h3>
<p>Try closing and reopening the app. If the issue persists, make sure your device is running iOS 15 or later and that you have the latest version of JaaiTang! installed.</p>
